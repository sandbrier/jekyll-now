I stumbled across [grugq's resources page](https://grugq.github.io/resources/) and my reading list expanded exponentially. Here a few standouts.

## Papers

[73 Rules of Spycraft](http://www.oss.net/dynamaster/file_archive/100102/0a947a77d762061cc87ec541c2d2dcc7/2010-01-02%20Dulles%20on%20Tradecraft%20via%20Srodes.pdf)
&gt;The greatest vice in the game is that of carelessness. Mistakes made generally cannot be rectified.

[How to Look for Trouble, A STRATFOR Guide to Protective Intelligence](http://wl.wikileaks-press.org/gifiles/attach/7/7133_Trouble_v4.pdf)
&gt;PI is based on the fact that attackes don't just happen out of the blue. Most follow a discernible attack cycle in which there are critical points when a polt is most likely to be detected by an outside observer.

## Guides and Wikis

[The "Complete" Guide to using Bitcoin Anonymously](https://99bitcoins.com/complete-guide-using-bitcoin-anonymously/) - A broad but useful post from 99bitcoins

## Current Events

[Paris terrorists used burner phones, not encryption, to evade detection](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/03/paris-terrorist-attacks-burner-phones-not-encryption/) - The pressure on encryption greatly intensified after the Paris attacks and yet we again have confirmation that the attackers relied upon SMS and burners. Oh well the truth is malleable. "We have always been at war with cryptopia".
> Until we have stronger evidence to the contrary, it seems likely that encryption played little or no part in the Paris terrorist attacks.

-'till next time, OscarAlphaOscar.
